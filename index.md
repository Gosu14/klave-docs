# Focus on developing trustless apps
{: .fs-9 }

Klave Network empowers developers and companies to create tamper-proof trustless applications protected by secure hardware and cryptography; expending the boundary of sensitive data management and sovereign data ownership.

> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of klave that is currently in closed alpha version.

Klave aims to provide the infrastructure railway for developer to easily develop privacy preserving trustless applications. Technologies behind confidential computing are complicated and not accessible to all developers. To keep developers focus on their critical business code, the klave network leverage on Secretarium Core to abstract away all complexity ensuring that all applications deployed runs within secure hardware enclaves, are distributed by default, and that associated ledgers stays encrypted and tamper proof at all time.

The primary focus is Privacy, developer friendliness by integrating natively within their workflow and scalability. In addition of addressing most of current solutions shortcomings (high througput, low latency, instant finality, ressources efficiency) it enables privacy preserving use cases such as the manipulation of sensitive data while keeping these secret at all time (at rest, in transit and during processing).

The trustlessness aspect of Klave is at the heart of the value proposal and proof of honesty can be gathered from the Network every step of the way. In additition of classic attestation such as proof of integrity and computation that can be seen in other trustless system, proof of privacy (proof that no one has access to the data on the platform even developers nor potential adverse parties having hacked into a server) is also provided by design.

Browse the docs to learn more about how to deploy your apps on Klave.
