# Vision

Klave Network empower developers and companies to create tamper-proof trustless applications protected by secure hardware and cryptography; expending the boundary of sensitive data management and sovereignty.

We believe in a future where trust and data oligopolies (aka. trusted third party) will be deprecated by technologies generalising the principle of falsification resistant computations and ledgers while guaranteeing integrity and privacy. This will become the new web standard and will be integrated in all developers workflow natively.
