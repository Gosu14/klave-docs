# Ambitions

The Trustless network aims to provide the infrastructure railway for developer to easily develop privacy preserving trustless applications. Indeed, technologies behind confidential computing are complicated and not accessible to all developers. To keep developers focus on their critical business code, the Trustless Network running on Secretarium Core abstract away all that complexity ensuring all applications deployed runs within secure hardware enclaves, are distributed by default, and that associated ledgers stays encrypted and tamper proof at all time.

The primary focus of the trustless network is Privacy, developer friendliness by integrating natively within their workflow and scalability. In addition of addressing most of current solutions shortcomings (high througput, low latency, instant finality, ressources efficiency) it enables privacy preserving use cases such as the manipualtion of sensitive data while keeping these secret at all time (at rest, in transit and during processing).

The trustlessness aspect of the Network is at the heart of the value proposal and proof of honesty can be gathered by developers and users from the Network every step of the way. In additition of classic attestation such as proof of integrity and computation that can be seen in other trustless system, proof of privacy (proof that no one has access to the data on the platform even developers nor potential adverse parties having hacked into a server) will be also given by design.

Although, most of Web3 use cases can be addressed by the Trustless Network, the first version will be a more centralised network living side by side with Web3 ecosystem. Going forward it is likely that the Trustless Network will evolved toward a more decentralised architecture similar to what Web3 is proposing.
