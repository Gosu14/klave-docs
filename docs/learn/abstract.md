# Abstract

Recently, multi-purpose trustless systems such as blockchains, were created with the intentions to reduce the cost of establishing trust, leveling the playing field and opening up the economy to micro-players, especially in finance (DeFi).

However blockchains, in additions of their documented shortcomings (high latency, lack of easy integration, finality issues, concentration in mining power, resource wastefulness) have inherent limitations regarding privacy. By design, blockchain needs to broadcast data for its censorship and falsification resistance properties to apply, limiting the use of sensitive data.

As a results, it forces companies to build "off-chains" infrastructure to manage private data defeating the purpose of using blockchain altogether for use cases dealing with sensitive data. Thus, a new generation of technologies must still be brought forward to protect data privacy while lowering the cost of establishing trust.

Recent developments in the field of Confidential computing and trusted execution environments, represent a unique opportunity to bring forth a new category of cryptographically secure, highly available, trustless systems with unparalleled performances. Meet the Trustless Network.
